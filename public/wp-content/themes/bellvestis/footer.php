			Fashion is made to become unfashionable. Money doesn't buy elegance. You can take an inexpensive sheath, add a pretty scarf, gray shoes, and a wonderful bag, and it will always be elegant. It's a question of survival. I love a black wedding dress. I feel that things happen for a reason and open up new opportunities.

			<p>There is always an emotional element to anything that you make. I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable. Fashion is about dressing according to what's fashionable. Style is more about being yourself. Confidence. If you have it, you can make anything look good. I always thought what you wore underneath was as important as what you wear on top.</p>
